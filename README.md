# MetroComp
MetroComp is a metro companion created using DSA concepts of maps, BFS and DFS. It will basically list the names of stations of Bhubaneswar and the distances between. With the given graph you can find the shortest route to any stations you want to. It is not designed using any markup languages so it is not a front-end/back-end project. But its quite interesting to plan a route using this approach.

# Information 
It is clearly known from the general knowledge and metro cities in India that Bhubaneswar doesn't have its own metro. So, its quite evident that I don't know detailed routes of Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, hyderabad and so on therefore, I have taken reference of this particular city which I think am quite aware of. Think of it like if there would be any metro introduced in the near future in Bhubaneswar how it would be.
